> briefly describe how you achieved the goals of the project 

Stored balances on the server using each public key. On the client side, I took a private key as input, turned that into a public key, and then used the private key to sign an object containing transaction info (sender, amount, recipient). In retrospect, I should have also included a timestamp, to prevent replay attacks.




### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server 

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!
